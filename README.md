React library for [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/).

## Installation

```
$ npm i react-fi
```

## Usage

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { FiActivity } from "react-fi";

const App = () => {
  return <FiActivity />;
};

export default App;
```

Icons can be configured with inline props :

```javascript
<FiActivity color="red" size={48} strokeWidth={4} />
```

Each and every SVG attribute is customizable. Here are few examples :

| Prop Name      | Default Value |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| fill           | none          |
| strokeWidth    | 2             |
| strokeLinecap  | round         |
| strokeLinejoin | round         |

You can also include the whole icon pack :

```javascript
import React from "react";
import * as ReactFI from "react-fi";

const App = () => {
  return <ReactFI.FiActivity />;
};

export default App;
```
